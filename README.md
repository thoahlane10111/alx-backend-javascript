0x01. ES6 Promises
JavaScript ES6 In this project, I worked on more ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) features as well as non-ES6 features, such as:

Promise object feature
Async/await
Throw/Try
Promises
Another JavaScript feature introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) A Promise is an object representing the eventual success or failure of an asynchronous operation. It was introduced as a way to address the issues brought about when using callbacks in nested operations--which made code difficult to read and maintain. This is called Callback Hell.

Async/await
This is an ES8 (2017) feature. It was built on top of Promises for a more robust asychronous programming. It makes code easier to read by doing away with .then() and .catch() methods used in chained promises.

Throw/Try
Throw is used to raise a user-defined exception. While Try is used with catch to trap any exception/error raised when executing code statements found within the context of the try block.

This project was done in fulfillment of my Back-End specialization study.
